The Purpose of this project is to extract insightful ideas from our Yelp's review dataset and generate helpful advice for business owners increasing their rating scores on Yelp.

## Repository Contents
There are three folders and three files in our repository named `Stat628-yelp`

- **Image**: we included all the plots supported our analysis in this file
- **Shinyapp**: we included our codes for ShinyApp
- **Report**: This is a four page summary of our analysis. The contents include our procedure of data cleaning, overall exploratory data analysis, key findings, and recommendation for business.
- **README.md**

## Directions of Using Code
We compliled our program in **R Studio**.
To run our program, you need to follow the steps described below
- Installed packages `jsonlite`, `tidytext`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, `plyr`, `wordcloud2`, `ggplot2`, `magrittr`, `tidyr`, `rlist`, `gridExtra` on your R Studio
- And then, You need to set up the working directory to main directory
- After you achieved the first two steps, you will be good to run our program :)
- Due to the size our original data, we did not upload it. Thus, you might not be able to run our code for cleaning data which included in our directory `code` and the first part of `final group code.R`. However, we included our data after cleaning in main directory. You will be good to run any other codes.
